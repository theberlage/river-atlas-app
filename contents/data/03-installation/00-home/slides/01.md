## Part III: Installation

The project explores the bridging of the physical and the digital by producing an atlas in both formats simultaneously, mediating between two different modes of representation and culminating in a final exhibition. The physical atlas contains eighteen plates of synthetic drawings in three scales—1:1000 for the neighborhood, 1:200 for the building, and 1:50 for the fragment. Printed and digitized through photography, geo-referenced and annotated, the drawings are posted on the City Atlas website, the carrier of the digital atlas. The different scales are overlapped in the digital platform, and zooming conceals or reveals different information. In addition to the drawings, the digital atlas contains a collection of maps, plans, images, and policies with links to archives.The drawings and evidence, presented in the exhibition, piece together a chronology of Amsterdam’s urban transformation.
