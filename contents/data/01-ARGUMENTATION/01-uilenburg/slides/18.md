# Uilenburg 1:50
The homes that existed on Uilenburg vary in size and spatial organization. The historical houses had a typical Dutch canal house layout, albeit much smaller in size and frequently a whole family would occupy only one room (1). In its place after the 20th century demolition, the new social housing block by J.H. Mulder is much more spacious with a four-room layout and a balcony (2), which could accommodate a family comfortably. The apartment complex developed by the end of the 1980s, renovated from the 17th century warehouses (3), reveals the contemporary need for small, one- or two-room apartments with a shared outdoor space. The drawing overlaps the footprint of these homes in their geographical location, showing demolition, reconstruction and renovation.
