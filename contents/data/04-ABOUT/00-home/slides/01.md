## City Atlas

City Atlas investigates mechanisms of urban transformation in Amsterdam from the late sixteenth century to the present. Through the lens of six emblematic sites, it traces physical changes resulting from processes of urban expansion and renewal, from the adaptation or renovation of buildings and blocks to the demolition and reconstruction of whole streets and neighborhoods. The project gathers information from archival sources to live-time satellite images to produce an atlas of synthetic drawings that reflect the spatial transformation of each site. With the aid of digital tools such as Allmaps, an open-source platform for georeferencing and exploring digitized maps, and Placemark, a program for annotating georeferenced maps, the project explores the possibility to overlay, compare, and annotate the built environment of Amsterdam at different moments in time. By linking maps of the city and its neighborhoods to drawings of buildings and public spaces, it intends to make visible relations between spatial developments at different scales. 

City Atlas is the second iteration of the Berlage’s long-standing Project NL design-research course in collaboration with Allmaps and the TU Delft library. The project is organized in three parts. The first part focuses on collecting, categorizing, and annotating archival materials to develop a comprehensive dossier on the spatial changes of the respective sites. The second part analyzes and translates the transformations into synthetic drawings, developing arguments that either affirm, broaden or complement a common historical narrative of each site. The third part summarizes the findings by compiling them into an exhibition, a digital application, and a final event.
