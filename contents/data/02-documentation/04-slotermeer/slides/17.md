# Revision on open blocks and the attention on greenery
The earliest neighborhood built with open blocks was Bos en Lommer. Considered as a testing of Cornelis van Eesteren’s Western Garden Cities, housing blocks with similar lengths were positioned in a repetitive pattern in the Bos en Lommer area. Benefiting from the previous experiment, when Slotermeer was finally put into construction after World War II in 1952, the improvement in diversifying the composition of housing blocks was clearly shown. Different lengths and orientations of blocks, circulations, and spaces between public streets and private residences were taken into account when composing the neighborhood.
With the neighborhood plan of Slotermeer, it is demonstrated that the greenery was a main structural system of the Western Garden Cities. Even on the 1:10000 plan, the greenery is illustrated with a high level of concern, as each tree is drawn separately.
