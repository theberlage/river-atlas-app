# The Ship Making Industry during the Dutch Golden Age
The city continued to expand in the 17th Century, as it replaced Antwerp and became the world’s most prominent trading port during what is now considered as the Dutch Golden Age. Harbors and the shipbuilding industry moved eastwards for more space. The Admiralty of Amsterdam moved to Rapenburg from the southwest corner of Uilenburg, soon followed by the Admiralty carpentry. Land on Uilenburg was freed up and sold in small plots. In this 1625 map by mapmaker Balthasar Florisz van Berckenrode, shipyards along the west side of Uilenburg were replaced by warehouses and houses. A narrow strip of shipyards remained on the east side, now only making small ships for domestic travels. A new bridge was constructed over Oudeschans.
