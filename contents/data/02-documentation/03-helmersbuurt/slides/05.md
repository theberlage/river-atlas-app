# Helmersbuurt
Map of the building sites owned by the company, Blikman and Sartorius, for the development of building sites along 'Overtoom.' The map is a representation of available and sold building sites and proposed the spatial planning of the Helmersbuurt. Here, the company’s plan to impose city blocks within the site area is evident following the municipal standard of 45 meter deep blocks and 15 meter wide streets.
