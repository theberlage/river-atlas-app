# Green Fabric & Accessibility
The promised green fabric of the town of the future was rigorously drafted out in the drawings. When compared, the cuts through the site reveal a rather intricate relationship of the ground to the vegetation, buildings and infrastructural elements. Moreover, all the residential blocks had multiple openings on the ground floor to allow for high pedestrian permeability. The individual apartments were accessible via inner streets on the first floor, which would have cafes, crèches and community spaces. Additionally, extensions of these community spaces were planned to spill out from the residential blocks and onto the green fabric, therefore establishing a direct relationship with the ground.
