# Figure - Ground
During the 1980s more proposals were made to counterbalance the vast empty spaces that were left unfinished due to the lack of funds from the construction corporations. This map illustrates the ratio of the built to the unbuilt, a unique figure-ground relationship found exclusively in the Bijlmer at the time. The horizon prevails.
