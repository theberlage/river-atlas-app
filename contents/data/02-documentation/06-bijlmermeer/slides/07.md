# Built & Public Nodes
When comparing the original proposal with the 1985 survey map from the Public Works Department, one aspect that stands out are the unrealized community spaces outside the building blocks, shown in red. Since none of these spaces were built (except for the very first H-buurt), the ground around them was developed differently from the original concept, and therefore affecting the public use and perception of the Maaiveld.
