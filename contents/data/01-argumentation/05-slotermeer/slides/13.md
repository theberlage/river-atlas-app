The 1979 and 2017 renovations of the playground in Jan Postmahof possess similarities and differences in spatial arrangement, chosen materials, and play equipment. The configuration of the playground was fragmented in both versions (1). It was part of the original design principles from Aldo van Eyck, applied when the playground was first constructed. Different from the 1979 version, the 2017 design brought back another principle of using neutral play objects (2), reintroducing a playfield without specific guidelines for children to play. In the meantime, the paving changed from hard to softer material to prevent kids from being injured (3). The construction of the concrete bench in 2017 increased enclosure (4). It functioned as a barrier to ensure maximum safety which is the main factor that guides the transformation, while keeping it possible also for adults to gather around the playground.
