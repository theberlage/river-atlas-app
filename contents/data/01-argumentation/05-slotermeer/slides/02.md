Slotermeer, constructed in 1952, was one of the oldest neighborhoods of the Western Garden Cities. With generous greenery and its own playgrounds, the area embodied the credo of providing residents with adequate light, air, and space. In comparison to the housing blocks that remained the same since the 1950s, the communal gardens experienced constant transformation. The housing units were completed in 1952, and the spaces in between were kept empty for the upcoming implementation of communal gardens with limited vegetation for visibility (1)(2). Prompted by increasing social issues, vegetation was densified in the 2000s, aiming to reduce connection with the public street. In 2017, after the registration of housing blocks in the area as protected cityscape, the communal gardens were rearranged based on the initial version of the 1950s. Clear visibility was reclaimed to provide a safer living environment in the neighborhood.
