New construction materials were applied on Vijzelstraat both for completely new structures and in micro-scale interventions to existing facades; these changes further influenced the adjacent functions. The twentieth century introduced the use of steel and reinforced concrete, which enabled the construction of large spans that could be filled with extensive glass surfaces. The facades of the new buildings, like Amstelstein, deployed the new materials and revolutionized the way shops interacted with pedestrians through visibility and comfort (1), while the existing buildings on the east side of Vijzelstraat also modernized the design, materials and dimensions of their facades (2). The original facades were designed with ornamental elements around the wooden window frames (3), whereas the new ones lacked the sculptural aspect and used steel frames to maximize public exposure of the interior.
