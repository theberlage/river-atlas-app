In the early twentieth century, Vijzelstraat underwent a major transformation in scale. Sixty-five buildings on its western side were demolished in 1926 to widen the street (1), to be replaced by two large volumes—an apartment complex and an office building. The transformation entailed modernizing traffic from a horse car system to cars and an electric tram system. The original seventeenth century buildings had three to four floors, whereas the new ones reached up to eight floors, providing the street a metropolitan scale. The apartment building ‘Amstelstein’ was designed by architect Jo van der Mey in 1928 with an arcade on the ground floor that accommodated new stores (3). In contrast, the office building of the trading company, constructed by Karel Petrus Cornelis De Bazel in 1926, did not account for such a function on the ground floor (2). Amstelstein was demolished in 1962 and was replaced by a modern office building, nonetheless maintaining ground floor shops and the metropolitan scale with a similar height and monumentality (4).
