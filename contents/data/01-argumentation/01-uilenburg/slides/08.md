# Scale 1:1000
With the Second Extension of Amsterdam, Uilenburg and Marken were created at the eastern edge of the city within its old fortification walls. Uilenburg in the sixteenth century was a shipbuilding site with only a strip of land (1), and with the east-ward migration of the shipyards in the seventeenth century, canals were filled for more land (2). Influenced by the early twentieth century concept of the modern city, the island was re-planned by the municipality following Woningwet 1901, with the two old streets merged into Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat and all houses in between demolished (3). East of Uilenburg, the island Marken experienced a more drastic transformation. Development of the tram and increasing car use led to the dissolution of Marken, where Valkenburgerstraat in the middle was widened to serve as a connection to Noord (4) and the eastern half faded into the urban fabric with the fill of Markengracht (5).
