# Scale 1:200
Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Uilenburg was populated by warehouses and residential houses that served as homes for mainly Jewish immigrants (1). It was common for the houses to have a storefront on the street level, rendering the streets vibrant commercial spaces for small businesses and shoppers (2). With the Woningwet 1901, most of the residential units on the island were declared “unlivable” and demolished in the early twentieth century, and in their place social housing blocks rose under the supervision of Municipal Housing Services (Gemeentelijke Woningdienst Amsterdam) (3). The street-level life was also altered by the policy. Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat was made wide for traffic (4), flanked with parking and speed bumps that no longer encourage active pedestrian activities. Many non-residential structures that survived the demolition were readapted for residential purposes instead of demolished by the end of the twentieth century. (5)
