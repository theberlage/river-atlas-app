# Cramped Homes
The row between Uilenburgerstraat and Batavierstraat was the earliest housing row on Uilenburg. While the outline of the row remained roughly the same, the small houses within experienced renovation, removal and reconstruction. The common configuration is two houses standing back to back on a width of approximately 15 meters. Plans of the small houses from the Stadsarchief Amsterdam show their cramped conditions. Some of these spaces house a family of up to 10 to 12 people on one floor.
