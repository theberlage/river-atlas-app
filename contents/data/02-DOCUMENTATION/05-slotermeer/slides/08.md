# Principles of the playgrounds in the 1950s 
As abundant numbers of reconstructions were carried out in the city of Amsterdam after World War II, alongside the number of children increasing rapidly, the lack of spaces for children to play in the neighborhood drew the attention of the Public Works Department. Aiming to provide children’s play with its own domain in the public sphere, Aldo van Eyck was appointed as an architectural designer in the town planning section by the department and created more than 700 play areas in the city from 1948 to 1978. The map of the playground on Jan Postmanhof demonstrated a playground constructed with Van Eyck's principles. The area was occupied in a fragmented way by 4 neutral play instruments which included the concrete sandpit, and multiple aluminum bars. On the boundary of the playground, instead of any kind of fences, benches were placed for parents to watch but not guide the children’s play. With two aluminum bars placed at the front of the access to the entrance of private housing, play was prioritized in the area.
