# The Evolution of the Buildings 
In 1960’s the former NHM building was purchased by Algemene Bank Nederland and only in 2007 became the city archive. The ‘Italian Room’ in the city archive, known for its Italian Renaissance wallpaper was originally located in the building of Herengracht 466 which belonged to NHM. When the trading company moved to its new headquarters in De Bazel in 1926, the old meeting room was taken with it and placed on the second floor of the new building. Following Amstelstein’s demolition the plot was purchased by Algemeen Bank Nederland that commissioned the modernist architect MF Duintjer to design the new building. An invisible but no less interesting part of the building is the tunnel under the Keizersgracht. Duintjer designed this tunnel to connect the new bank building with the De Bazel building that was housing the rest of the bank’s offices at that time. The underpass quickly acquired the nickname 'the Poentunnel' among Amsterdam residents.
