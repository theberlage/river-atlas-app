# Introducing new building scales
One of the new buildings was the house for the headquarters of the trading company Nederlandsche Handel Maatschappij (NHM) and was constructed in 1926.It was designed by the urban planner De Bazel who was inspired by Peter Behrens and it was 35 meters high, exceeding by far the typical number of floors of the former houses in the street. Amstelstein was constructed by Jan Van der May originally in 1928 as an apartment building on a plinth of shops. However this building partly collapsed in 1955 and was demolished in 1962.
