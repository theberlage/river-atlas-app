# Mixed-use Functions along the Vijzelstraat in the 19th century
Following Amsterdam’s fourth extension, the city entered a long period of stagnation with little transformation in the city. In the second half of the 19th century, the Vijzelstraat maintained its commercial character as a narrow but lively shopping street with clothing stores, bakeries and pharmacies on the ground floor and residences on top. This building type's height varied from 3 to 4 floors with commerce on the ground floor and housing on top were common on these perpendicular streets that crossed the canals, like Vijzelstraat.

In this slide, we can see the examples of Vijzelstraat 105 and 106 that showcase this typology of an open space on the ground floor for commercial use.
