# Houthavens and land manipulation
The syntactic drawing aims to emphasize the relation of the Houthavens area with the manipulation of land and, therefore, borderline. Since the beginning it seemed important – functional-wise – to establish a parallelism between building and water (represented through the ‘comb’ structure). This relation got lost the minute the program declined, failed to be rescued until the construction of the new masterplan. The new intervention implies that efforts were made to maintain a spatial connection with the former timber harbor in the scale of the island/pier, concerning its width, and in the scale of the building/apartments, regarding its modularity. Nonetheless, when looking at the island’s/pier’s “profile”, the layers diverge considerably affecting the relationship between architecture and water.
