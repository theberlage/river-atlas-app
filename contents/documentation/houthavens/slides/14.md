# Now vs. Then
On the other hand, the warehouse's plans demonstrate a much simpler relationship between building and water. There was almost no public space, and the architectural interventions were limited to the ground floor plan, apart from eventual points of structural unloading. Even the canals had the same size and depth, being able to shelter the same types of boats. This indicates a strictly functional character of the former Houthavens. However, when comparing the modularity of the apartments with the structural modules of the warehouses, one realizes they are analogous. The width of the apartments follows, in some degree, the width of the warehouses (or sometimes something about half of the module) - establishing once more a spatial affinity between old and new.
