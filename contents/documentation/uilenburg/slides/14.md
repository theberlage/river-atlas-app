# Warehouses’ New Lives
Over the course of the 20th Century, with the developing public practice of regulating and managing residential spaces and neighborhoods, Uilenburg transformed into a quiet neighborhood with greenery, sanitary services and other public facilities, followed by a series of private developments and renovations of the existing warehouses that were not managed by the municipality. The warehouses on Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat welcomed a new life in the late 20th Century. In 1985, warehouses in Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat 13-23 were cut open in the middle and renovated into a modern apartment complex with a shared courtyard, still keeping the original wall structure.
