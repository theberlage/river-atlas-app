## Water Board (1961)

These decentralized water boards used land differently than reality. While the decentralized water boards were each able to respond to specific needs, their land use differs from the Dutch river landscape today, where development is often adjacent to the river. Projects such as Room for the River counter some of the outcomes of this proximity. If funds for the river were not so evenly distributed maybe the river would have reclaimed areas on its own. The contrasting water boards presented in this speculative history question the current balance of risk prevention, finances, and development.
