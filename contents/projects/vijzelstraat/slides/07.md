# The new Metropolis
Kalff’s proposal for the expansion of the city towards the south and the Housing act of 1901 addressed the needs of the growing population. The new plan, alongside the construction of notable cultural landmarks such as the Rijksmuseum, necessitated the connection of the city center and the new railway station to the recently expanded area, located south of the existing 19th-century city belt. At the same time, Kalff’s plan responded to the ambition of a city formation with big boulevards suitable for car traffic, metropolitan buildings and the construction of an extensive tramway system. The implementation of all the above and the response to the new regional functions, resulted in substantial urban interventions within the historical center such as the filling of some canals and the demolition of several existing buildings. One of these cases was the Vijzelstraat that was chosen to be extended in order to accommodate the new infrastructure.
