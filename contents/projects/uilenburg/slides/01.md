# The transformation of Uilenburg & Marken
The island Uilenburg, constructed as part of Amsterdam’s Second Extension in the late Sixteenth Century for shipbuilding, had witnessed the city’s growth through changes in its outline, plotlines and buildings. While frequently associated with the Jewish population, characterized by its cramped conditions and the abrupt early Twentieth Century demolition and reconstruction under Woningwet 1901, many non-residential constructions survived the clearance and were later converted into different types of homes.
Changes in domestic spaces and consequently street-level public spaces capture the transformation on the islands, as shifts in home size, room number, block organization and neighborhood activities occurred overtime with economic growth, demographic change, and policy making. The city welcomed an influx of immigrants in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries, resulting in a dense matrix of small, multi-family houses—inheriting the typology of earlier shipyard worker dwellings—with businesses on ground floor; the Twentieth Century concept of hygiene and urban planning led to housing regulations, followed by the replacement of small houses with new social housing blocks; the late Twentieth Century need for single and two person homes promoted the transformation and subdivision of old warehouse interiors into apartments.
The domestic space is often neglected as a subject of urban transformation because of its vulnerability to contingencies, yet patterns caused by large-scale mechanisms such as policies, change in societal philosophies and economic trends could be observed. The various homes and their surroundings depicted in the drawings are lenses that provide a glimpse to the city’s transformation overtime.
