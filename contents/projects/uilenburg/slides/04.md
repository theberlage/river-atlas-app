# Immigrants and Homes
By approximately 1680, all shipyards moved to newer eastern islands. Uilenburg and Marken were transitioning into residential areas for workers in Kattenburg, Wittenberg and Oostenburg. With the clearing of shipyards and warehouses, plots on Uilenburg were reorganized. The lack of clear regulations in this area caused the land to be divided and sold in many small plots for more profit. Cheapness and proximity to the shipyards attracted many new immigrants, mainly Eastern European, to settle here, leading to the later formation of slums and alleys. In the 1724 map made by mapmaker Gerrit de Broen jr., it is clearly visible that the eastern outline of Uilenburg had grown outwards, making the island wider. All shipyards were replaced by warehouses or houses by this time.
