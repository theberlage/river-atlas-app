# Uilenburg & Marken 1:1000
The drawing depicts the islands of Uilenburg and Marken in three historical periods, the lower part based on a 1597 map of Amsterdam, the middle 1876 Loman Atlas, and the upper the present. Uilenburg in the 16th century was a shipbuilding site with only a strip of land (1), and with the east-ward migration of the shipyards in the 17th century, canals were filled (2) to create a widened residential island. Influenced by the early 20th century emerging urban planning concepts, the island was re-planned by the municipality, the two old streets merged into Nieuwe Uilenburgerstraat and all houses in between demolished (3). Development in transportation devices and urban infrastructures led to the dissolution of Marken, where Valkenburgerstraat in the middle was widened to serve as a connection to Noord (4) and the eastern half faded into the urban fabric with the fill of Markengracht.
