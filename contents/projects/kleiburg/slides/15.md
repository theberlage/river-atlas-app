Nassuth’s proposal depicted clusters of collective spaces in every residential block which remained unrealised. Therefore, one such cluster is imagined combining archival material to produce a synthetic detailed drawing. Inscribed within the existing structure of the building block, a sunk-in ground floor space is reconstructed from fragments of other collective areas within the site. An exterior structure then interconnects the ground floor with the elevated internal passage that is used to follow the length of the whole building. The fictionalized drawing technique is used as a tool for reflection on the multifaceted nature of the site, gathering scenarios that have existed elsewhere in the Bijlmer at some point in time, resulting in a condensed image of possibilities.
