# Houthavens 1:50
At a closer scale, the four phases evidence programmatic relations to the transformations of the borderline. In the earliest period, warehouses (1) occupied integrally the piers width, facilitating wood shipment and unloading  - which would come fluctuating through the water. Around 1950 these canals began to be filled (2), after the port fell into disuse. Up until the late Twentieth Century, construction-related companies (3) occupied the empty warehouses and used the filled canals for parking and circulation. Moving closer to bigger harbors, these companies migrated, resulting in the warehouse’s demolition (4) and further construction of multilevel housing blocks, in the 2010s. Buildings located in the Wiborgeiland include semi-private terraces, underground garages and living spaces. With the addition of canals, water was physically brought closer to such spaces and also interpreted for leisure and housing purposes.
