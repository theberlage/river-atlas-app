# The Houthavens as a residential area
The strategic position of the Houthavens area, plus its increasing condition as a residential neighborhood, put the area on the spot for future expansion projects of Amsterdam. While the area was being locus of temporary housing, a masterplan began to be developed, largely embedded on the ideal of a ‘compact city’ and aiming for the establishment of a multifunctional neighborhood. In other words, a mix between housing and work. At first, there were some financial issues regarding its budget and reluctance from the industries located nearby, but in 2009 the Zoning plan was approved and in 2014 the interventions initiated. As the plan extrapolates the Houtahaven’s original footprint, the borderline had to be manipulated once more. The filling was made in phases, starting from the edges towards the center.
