# The struggle of the openness
This drawing comes as a reply from the director of the Public Works Department, pointing out concerns about the ‘incorrect use’ of the communal courtyards for the first time. His drawing proposes that the once wide-open access on the south side in between the housing block should be a barrier by lower hedges and a row of trees standing between the housing area and the public street, transforming the space from a welcoming greenery to a garden preserved for residents. However, there was still no physical fence placed between the public sidewalks and the neighborhood courtyard.
