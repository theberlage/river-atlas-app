The drawing indicates the constant transformation of the communal courtyards and other types of public spaces in Slotermeer, in comparison with the housing blocks that remained as they were constructed in the 50s up to the present since they were registered as preserved cityscape in 2007. The four different periods of public spaces showcase the transition from emptiness (1) at the beginning, as they were kept for upcoming plans (2) from the Public Works Department in the 50s, to clean and limited arrangement of vegetation (3) after construction, densification of the vegetation (4) in the 2000s, and reclamation of clear visibility (5)(6) in the search for safety after 2017.
