# Re-assessment of the 1950s public spaces principles
Both the communal courts and the playground were reconstructed while the housing blocks were thoroughly restored while keeping the structural frame between 2015 to 2018. 
Inside the communal courtyards, the dense shrubs planted at the center were removed, the hedges on both ends of the blocks were replaced by visible fences. With the communal greenery being separated by physical barriers, the way of entering the housing blocks is officially reduced to one, from the entrance near the playground and parking lot. In between the neighborhood street on the east side and the playground, the same species of trees but in smaller diameters were replanted to the exact same location, shrubs were now planted in a more narrow and more restricted area in front of the entrance. 
Regarding the playground, the accesses to housing entrances cut through the area, directly leading people’s way home, making the playground fragmented into 4 smaller sections.
Areas with soft flooring covered most of the surface, and low benches alongside the perimeter were built as discrete borders, providing even higher safety features for children’s play. Neutral objects from Aldo van Eyck’s principles of design once again appeared to set the playground as a place for children to explore by themselves.
