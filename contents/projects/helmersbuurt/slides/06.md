Through the juxtaposition of historic maps with the current site, the relationship between the retrofitted plan with the pre-existing fabric becomes evident. The property grid that formed the Stads Polder acted as the formative outline for the planning of Helmersbuurt. The spatial organization respected two main restrictions: the Overtoomsevaart, and maintaining the approach to The Pesthuis. The grid follows the standard dimensions of 45-meter-deep blocks with 15-meter-wide streets. This standard was superimposed across the neighborhood. As a result site-wide demolitions took place and Helmersbuurt redeveloped from its previous recreational and industrial zoning to an orderly upper class residential area. In the early Twentieth Century, the existing fabric along the Overtoom was subsequently removed and rebuilt following the adapted urban plan.
